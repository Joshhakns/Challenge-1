# Challenge-1 
## Description
Refactoring Starter Code in order to make it more accesable. I worked on this project in order to practice my capabilities refactoring starter code and making it more accesable to the general public. My goal was to take code that was already designed for me and tweak it to where it would be more friendly to those who might be disabbled and/or use a screen reader.    
The problem I solved was to add semantic HTML and different alt text throughout the code in order to make this code easily accesable. 
I learned that while semantic HTML isn't always our first thought as programmers that it is important to have in case someone who can't read our code comes along and needs to work on it. 
## Usage
This application is a simple web browser. In order to test the links to see if they work simply click them. In order to see the semantic HTML I worked on you will have to go to DevTools in Chrome and view them there.
